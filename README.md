Evolution of Evolutionary Linguistics
This project aims to analyse the causal relationships among the different concepts discussed in published papers in Evolutionary Linguistics. 

Evolutionary Linguistics:
When and how did language originate? Why is Homo sapiens the only species that possesses a complex linguistic structure? How does language get transmitted to new learners and eventually modified in the process? These are the kinds of questions that evolutionary linguistics aims to answer. It is a multidisciplinary field of science that combines researches from linguistics, archaeology, biology, neuroscience, mathematics and computer science.

We have 413 research papers published between 1886 to 2022, in which the essential concepts in the theories called 'variables' connect based on cause and effect relationships downloaded from the data base [CHIELD - Causal Hypothesis in Evolutionary Linguistics](https://correlation-machine.com/CHIELD/index.html).
